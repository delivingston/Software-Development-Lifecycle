# Software-Development-Lifecycle

1.	Creating user stories helps me fully understand what they are asking for when writing the code. With this information, I can create a product with a better understanding and give the customer an example.

2.	I would approach developing programs by asking for help from my team. The Agile process that I believe I would incorporate is peer-to-peer development.

3.	To be a good team member, is to share the knowledge that I have.
